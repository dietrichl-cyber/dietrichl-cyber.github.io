# Welcome

I am a researcher in botany and science education. My work fosuses on treeline research as well as ecological education, plant awareness and perception, and the use of AI-supported learning environments in higher education teaching.

## Research interests

- Molecular reasons for the global treeline phenomenon
- Ecological literacy and scientific literacy  
- Plant awareness and perception  
- AI-supported learning environments (e.g., chatbots as learning companions)
