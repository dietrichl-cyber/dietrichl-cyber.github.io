# Research

## Main research areas

I am working on research projects in the areas of biology education and plant ecology and the combination of the two. I am especially interested in how an effective education on ecology can help students understand the complex and emergent processes of ecosystems.

## Projects

- Ecological Literacy

  
- Data Literacy


- Plant Awareness


- Tree growth in cold climates
